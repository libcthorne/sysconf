# Partition sizes

A record of partition sizes I've tried using.

## 16/06/27

Ubuntu 15.04 (after one year of usage)

* 6.52GiB swap space; seemingly fine
* 28.39GiB system space; just over 50% used
* 39.59GiB for /home; 90% used, **too small**

Windows (after one year of usage)

* 100MiB system reserved; seemingly fine (automatically allocated)
* 38.96GiB system+home space; 90% used, **slightly too small**
